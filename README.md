# Anaerobic Membrane Bioreactor (AnMBR)

This repository contains the MATLAB codes used in [Shoener et al., 2016](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2016/ee/c5ee03715h) for the design, simulation, techno-economic analysis (TEA), and life cycle assessment (LCA) of different anaerobic membrane bioreactor (AnMBR) configurations and the conventional activated sludge (AS) process.

- `MATLAB_Code_Summary.pdf` contains the description of the codes.
- `System_Design.pdf` contains the schematics of the different system setup.
- `Terms_Definitions_and_Design_Calculations_AnMBR.docx` and `Terms_Definitions_and_Design_Calculations_AS.docx` contain the design equations for AnMBR and the conventional AS process used for comparison, respectively.
- Files with `.m` and `.mat` extensions are MATLAB files (`.m` are codes and `.mat` are data, respectively).
